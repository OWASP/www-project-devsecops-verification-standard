The OWASP DevSecOps Verification Standard (DSOVS) is an open source framework that defines baseline requirements for any software project or organisation. You can use the DSOVS for:


* 🧐 **Gap Analysis** 
    * DSOVS can be used to identify gaps that exist within a single or multiple software projects by providing internal or external analysts with well defined categories that cover all steps of the software development lifecycle. 

* 🗺️ **Maturity Roadmap** 
    * DSOVS can be used by developers, architects, security people and anyone else to identify existing DevSecOps maturity levels whilst mapping a clear path to work towards heightened maturity.

* ⚠️ **During Third-party Risk Asessments** 
    * DSOVS can be used to audit the software development lifecycle (SDLC) maturity of third-parties which is important as it ensures that their software development processes are up resilient and helps identify any potential vulnerabilities that exist due to people, processes or software.
