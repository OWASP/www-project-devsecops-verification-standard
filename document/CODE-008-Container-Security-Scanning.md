# Container Security Scanning

## Summary

Container security scanning is a process of analysing the contents of containers to detect any vulnerable components, configuration issues, and malicious code. 

This process is important in DevSecOps as it allows developers to quickly identify any security risks in their container environment, allowing them to take steps to fix them before they become an issue. 

By scanning containers on a regular basis, organisations are able to keep their environments secure and compliant with industry best practices while also allowing them to take advantage of the agility and cost advantages offered by containers.

## Level 0 - No tool to perform container vulnerability analysis

At this level, there is no scanning tool in place, and vulnerabilities may go undetected until it is too late. Organizations operating at this level are more susceptible to cyber attacks, and may struggle to achieve compliance with industry standards.

## Level 1 - Verify tool is used to perform on-demand scan for container vulnerability analysis

Using a tool for on-demand scanning provides some level of security, but requires manual intervention and may cause delays in detecting vulnerabilities. This level can help organizations to quickly identify and address security issues, but may not be sufficient to provide continuous protection.


## Level 2 - Verify the implementation of container vulnerability analysis tool into the build pipeline to perform automated scans and report status to the build

By integrating a container scanning tool into the build pipeline, security checks become automated and vulnerabilities can be detected earlier in the development process. This level enables organizations to scale their DevSecOps practices and ensures that security is incorporated into the software development life cycle.

## Level 3 - Verify that the findings are automatically recorded to a centralised issue tracker system and periodically review tool's effectiveness

At this level, the container scanning process is not only automated but also integrated with a central issue tracker system, allowing for greater visibility and easier tracking of security issues. Periodic reviews of the effectiveness of the scanning tool can help organizations continuously improve their security posture and stay ahead of emerging threats.
