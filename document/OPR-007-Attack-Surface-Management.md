## Summary

Attack surface management (ASM) solutions and tools are used to identify, track, and manage the vulnerabilities present in an organization's digital infrastructure, including software, hardware, and networks.

The goal of ASM is to reduce the organization's overall attack surface, which is the sum of all the points in its digital infrastructure that could potentially be exploited by cybercriminals. By reducing the attack surface, organizations can better protect themselves from cyber attacks and reduce their risk of a successful breach.

ASM solutions and tools typically provide a comprehensive view of an organization's digital assets, including those that are hidden or forgotten. They also identify vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in software, systems, and networks, which can be used by attackers to gain unauthorized access or cause damage.

Some of the benefits of ASM solutions and tools for cybersecurity in organizations include:

1. Improved visibility: ASM solutions provide a comprehensive view of an organization's digital assets, which allows for better visibility and understanding of the security risks and vulnerabilities present in the system.

2. Proactive approach: ASM solutions enable organizations to take a proactive approach to security by identifying and addressing vulnerabilities before they are exploited by cybercriminals.

3. Enhanced threat intelligence: ASM tools can provide valuable threat intelligence by tracking the latest threats and vulnerabilities, allowing organizations to prioritize and address the most critical risks.

4. Compliance: ASM solutions can help organizations comply with various regulatory requirements and standards, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS).

5. Cost savings: ASM solutions can help organizations reduce the costs associated with data breaches and cyber attacks by addressing vulnerabilities and reducing the likelihood of a successful attack.

Overall, ASM solutions and tools are essential for maintaining strong cybersecurity posture in organizations, providing better visibility, proactive approach, enhanced threat intelligence, compliance, and cost savings.

## Level 0 - No tool to perform real-time discovery, classify, assess and monitor the security organisation's IT assets

Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum

## Level 2 - Verify that discovered organisation's IT assets are properly classified and any identified possible attack vectors are automatically prioritised

Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum

## Level 3 - Verify that the findings are automatically recorded to a centralised issue tracker system and periodically review tool's effectiveness
