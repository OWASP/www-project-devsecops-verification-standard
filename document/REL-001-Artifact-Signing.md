## Summary

Artifact signing is a security process that ensures the integrity of an artifact/binary that is released by a developer. 

This is done by using cryptographic and digital signing techniques to ensure that the artifact has not been tampered with and no malicious code has been inserted into it

Artifact signing is important for DevSecOps because it allows organizations to quickly and easily verify the authenticity of their software or applications before allowing them to be deployed into production environments. More recently, Code Signing has gained in popularity due to Supply Chain Security attacks, and used as one method in the application of security to build pipelines. 

It also provides a measure of assurance that their applications are secure and trustworthy, helping to build customer trust and loyalty.

## Level 0 - No package/code signing process defined

At this level, software deliverables are not digitally signed, leaving them vulnerable to unauthorized code access. There is no auditability or integrity assurance behind the software. Organizations operating at this level face significant security risks and lack the means to verify the authenticity of their code.

## Level 1 - Basic code signing with self managed keys

In this stage, software deliverables are signed, but the tools and processes are fragmented. Developers may handle their own private keys without centralized control, which can lead to key misuse or compromise. While some level of security is introduced, it falls short of ensuring comprehensive code integrity, authenticity, non-falsifiability and is not tamper proof.

## Level 2 -  Centralized code signing with enhanced key security

Level 2 involves the use of a centralized platform for code signing policy, workflow, and auditability. It also emphasizes the protection of sensitive signing keys in a secure Hardware Security Module (HSM). However, at this stage, code signing is not yet fully integrated with CI/CD processes or workflows, and not all use cases are covered. While this level offers improved security, it still lacks the full automation and integration required for DevSecOps. Typically at this level, organisations leverage key manage solutions such as AWS KMS, HashiCorp Vault, etc.

## Level 3 - Fully CI/CD integrated code signing and governance

At the highest level of this code signing maturity model, organizations have achieved full integration of code signing into their CI/CD processes. This means that all containers, artifacts, and software deliverables are signed. The implementation is seamlessly integrated with native signing tools and workflows, ensuring full auditability and governance over all signing processes. This level provides the highest level of security, code integrity, and authenticity, meeting the demands of modern DevSecOps practices. Typically at this level, organisations adopt keyless signing (a newer signing technique where you do not handle long-lived signing keys).

## [cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign)

cosign is an open source CLI utility for signing softwae artifacts, such as container images or blob files (i.e. bundled AWS Lambda code in a .zip file, or any type of software artifact)
